# Wildcard Ideas (Post-MVP or for Inspiration) for Things+

This document outlines potential future development paths and feature suggestions for the Things+ application, based on ideas explored after defining the core Minimum Viable Product (MVP). These concepts are designed to significantly enhance the user experience and expand the app's capabilities in the long term.

## Theme 1: Enhanced User Engagement & Motivation

The goal of this theme is to make productivity feel more rewarding and to build positive, long-term habits.

### 1.1 Gamification
- **Streaks & Goals:** Introduce a feature for users to set a daily goal (e.g., "Complete 3 tasks" or "Study for 1 hour"). The app would track and display a "streak" for consecutive days the goal is met, providing a powerful psychological motivator.
- **XP & Levels:** Grant Experience Points (XP) for completing tasks. As users accumulate XP, they can "level up," providing a tangible sense of progression and accomplishment.
- **Achievements/Badges:** Award badges for various milestones and behaviors to create moments of delight and encourage exploration of the app's features. Examples include:
    - **"Planner":** For scheduling a task more than a week in advance.
    - **"Night Owl":** For completing a task after midnight.
    - **"Finisher":** For completing every task in a given week.

### 1.2 Personalized Analytics & Reports
- **Weekly Summaries:** At the end of each week, the app could generate a personalized report, summarizing key metrics like "Tasks Completed," "Hours Studied," and "Most Productive Day."
- **Course-Specific Insights:** Provide analytics on which courses are consuming the most time and effort, helping students identify areas where they may need to adjust their strategy.

## Theme 2: Proactive Intelligence (AI Assistant)

This theme focuses on making the app feel less like a passive tool and more like an intelligent personal assistant.

### 2.1 Proactive Scheduling & Task Management
- **Task Decomposition:** For large, multi-step tasks (e.g., "Final Research Paper"), the AI could suggest breaking them down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks like "Topic Proposal," "Outline," "First Draft," and "Final Revisions."
- **Energy-Based Scheduling:** Allow users to define their daily high and low energy periods. The AI would then prioritize scheduling demanding, high-effort tasks during peak energy times.
- **Task Clustering:** The AI could identify multiple small, related tasks (e.g., several readings for the same course) and suggest grouping them into a single, focused study block.

### 2.2 Burnout Prevention
- **Schedule Density Analysis:** The app could analyze the user's calendar and task list for the upcoming weeks. If it detects an overly packed schedule with no downtime, it could generate a gentle warning: "Your schedule looks intense for the next few weeks. Don't forget to schedule some time to relax."

## Theme 3: Seamless Workflow Integration

This theme is about reducing friction and integrating Things+ more deeply into the user's existing workflows.

### 3.1 Integrated Focus Mode
- **Pomodoro Timer:** A built-in Pomodoro timer that users can start for any task, tracking focused work sessions and breaks.
- **Distraction Blocking:** Integration with system APIs or browser extensions to temporarily block a user-defined list of distracting websites and apps during a focus session.
- **Music Integration:** Connect to services like Spotify or Apple Music to automatically play a user's preferred "Study" or "Focus" playlist when a focus session begins.

### 3.2 Advanced Input Methods
- **Photo/Screenshot to Task:** Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to allow users to create a task by taking a photo of a syllabus or a screenshot of a course announcement. The app would automatically parse the title, due date, and description.
- **Email to Task:** Provide each user with a unique, private email address. Forwarding an email to this address would automatically convert its content into a task in their Things+ inbox.
