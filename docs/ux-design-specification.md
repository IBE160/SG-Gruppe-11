## Executive Summary

Things+ is a web application designed to help working students manage time and stress by unifying tasks from Canvas and Google Calendar, and smartly identifying free study time. Its goals are to improve user effectiveness and engagement through AI-driven development. The app targets "Jugglers" (older, busy students) and "Ambitious Starters" (younger, motivated students), offering features like Canvas/Google Calendar integration, smart scheduling, and unified views, all built on principles of clarity, empowerment, efficiency, personalization, and engagement.

## 2. Core User Experience

### 2.1 Defining Experience

The core experience of Things+ is designed to be fast and frictionless. Users will primarily be viewing today's tasks, completing them, and adding new ones. The dashboard will load quickly and be easy to navigate. Adding a new task will be effortless, with an always-visible plus button and keyboard shortcuts. The most critical user action is updating and completing tasks, which will happen with a single click and without unnecessary dialogs or steps. The platform will be web-based and designed for modern desktop browsers.

### 2.2 Novel UX Patterns

### 2.3 Desired Emotional Response

Users of Things+ should experience a sense of calm control with a quiet sense of momentum. After a session, they should feel grounded, capable, and a little proud, which will encourage them to recommend the application.
